#Environment Setup

The wizards at Flatiron Labs made a script to set up your machine for development. Checkout the main page [here](https://github.com/flatiron-school/environmentalizer)

## Getting Started
After installing XCode, and reading ["What you need before you begin"](https://github.com/flatiron-school/environmentalizer#what-you-need-before-you-begin), run this line of code. You will be prompted for your password a few times.
 Please note that Command line tools come installed with the latest version of XCode.

`curl -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatiron-school/environmentalizer/master/runner.sh" | bash`

Sit back, and watch out for any errors.
